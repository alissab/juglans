# Biogeographic history of *Juglans cinerea* (butternut)
This project focuses on the migration history of a tree of conservation concern in eastern North America over the last 21,000 years (i.e., since the Last Glacial Maximum). 

### R folder
- **pull_butternut_data.R**
This code pulls fossil pollen records from the [Neotoma database](https://www.neotomadb.org/); performs data cleaning; and projects site coordinates in an Albers equal-area projection.
- **biotic_velocity.R** 
This code analyzes butternut pollen data (pollen record distance to glacier over time; migration speed/biotic velocity over time) and visualizes pollen records over time in relation to glacial coverage and habitat suitability estimates. 

### Shapefiles folder
- North American shapefiles
- Great Lakes (North America) shapefiles

### Figs
This folder contains exploratory figures, mainly showing locations of butternut pollen records across eastern North America over the last 21,000 years.
